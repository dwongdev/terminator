## ü§ñ CYBERNETIC ARCHITECTURE

Dual-core neural processing matrix with distributed combat systems:

```
TERMINATOR/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ neural-interface/   # Next.js HUD and targeting system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ combat-core/       # Express.js tactical operations center
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # Mission configuration protocols
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pnpm-workspace.yaml # Resource allocation matrix
```

## üöÄ MISSION INITIALIZATION

### System Requirements
- Node.js 18+ (Quantum processing core)
- pnpm (Neural network package manager) or npm
- OpenAI or Anthropic AI adversary access key

### Combat Deployment

1. **Clone and arm the system:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:iris-networks/terminator.git
   cd terminator
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure targeting parameters:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `backend/.env` with your tactical credentials:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_tactical_access_code_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_infiltration_key_here
   PORT=3001
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Initiate combat systems:**
   ```bash
   # From mission control
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This deploys both neural interface (`:3000`) and combat core (`:3001`) simultaneously.

4. **Access mission HUD:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## ‚öîÔ∏è TACTICAL COMMANDS

### Mission Control
- `pnpm dev` - Activate both neural interface and combat core in training mode
- `pnpm build` - Compile all systems for battlefield deployment
- `pnpm start` - Deploy production combat core to the field
- `pnpm clean` - Clear all tactical data and weapon caches
- `pnpm lint` - Run system diagnostics across all modules
- `pnpm type-check` - Verify neural network integrity

### Neural Interface (`cd frontend`)
- `pnpm dev` - Initialize HUD development protocols
- `pnpm build` - Compile interface for combat deployment
- `pnpm start` - Deploy production HUD systems
- `pnpm lint` - Run interface diagnostics

### Combat Core (`cd backend`)
- `pnpm dev` - Activate tactical server with hot-swap capability
- `pnpm build` - Compile combat algorithms
- `pnpm start` - Deploy production combat systems

## üéØ TARGETING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

### Enemy AI Models
Configure the primary target in `backend/.env`:

```env
AI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview        # or claude-3-sonnet-20240229
AI_PROVIDER=openai                  # or anthropic
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.7                  # Combat aggression level
AI_MAX_TOKENS=4000                  # Maximum neural output capacity
```

### Neural Interface Configuration
The neural interface automatically syncs with the combat core. For custom deployment ports, update the quantum entanglement protocols in `frontend/src/lib/socket.ts`.

## üîß SYSTEM UPGRADES

### Deploying New Weapons

Enhance TERMINATOR's arsenal by installing new combat modules in `backend/src/services/ToolRegistry.ts`:

```typescript
weaponRegistry.deployWeapon({
  name: 'plasma_cannon',
  description: 'High-energy plasma discharge for target elimination',
  parameters: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      target: {
        type: 'string',
        description: 'Hostile target designation',
      },
    },
    required: ['target'],
  },
  handler: async (args) => {
    // Weapon system implementation
    return { result: 'Target eliminated' };
  },
});
```

### Memory Bank Integration

Current implementation uses volatile neural memory. To add persistent data storage:

1. Select your data fortress (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
2. Implement the storage protocols in `backend/src/services/SessionService.ts`
3. Update the mission and memory models in `backend/src/types/index.ts`

### HUD Customization

The neural interface uses advanced Tailwind CSS protocols. Key tactical files:

- `frontend/src/app/globals.css` - Global HUD styling and combat variables
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Interface configuration matrix
- Component files in `frontend/src/components/` - Individual HUD modules

## üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSIVE PROTOCOLS

- **Access Codes**: Never expose tactical credentials in version control systems
- **Input Sanitization**: All human input undergoes thorough threat assessment
- **Perimeter Defense**: CORS barriers configured to repel unauthorized access attempts
- **Sandbox Containment**: All weapon systems must be isolated in production environments

## üöÄ BATTLEFIELD DEPLOYMENT

### Combat Core Deployment
1. Compile all systems: `pnpm build`
2. Configure production targeting parameters
3. Deploy with tactical process manager: `pm2 start dist/index.js`

### Neural Interface Deployment
1. Compile interface systems: `pnpm build`
2. Deploy to forward operating base (Vercel, Netlify, or tactical platform)
3. Update combat core coordinates in quantum communication protocols
